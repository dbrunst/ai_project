## AI Intro

I wanted to compare Google's Vertex AI with Open AI with a real use case
The use case I chose is parsing authorship data from a string that contains a lot of garbage data.
you can find the example of the strings I used to test with here in the raw_data.json

### To run the Vertex AI version:
`python author_list_google.py`

### To run the Open AI version:
`python author_list_open_ai.py`
